# The compression algorithms are:
# ALGO_INTERP_LORENZO
#     The default algorithm in SZ3. It is the implementation of our ICDE'21 paper.
#     The whole dataset will be compressed by interpolation or lorenzo predictor with auto-optimized settings.
# ALGO_INTERP
#     The whole dataset will be compressed by interpolation predictor with default settings.
# ALGO_LORENZO_REG
#     The whole dataset will be compressed by lorenzo and/or regression based predictors block by block with default settings.
#     The four predictors ( 1st-order lorenzo, 2nd-order lorenzo, 1st-order regression, 2nd-order regression)
#     can be enabled or disabled independently by conf settings (Lorenzo, Lorenzo2ndOrder, Regression, Regression2ndOrder).
# ALGO_DUALQUANT
#     Adopation of vecSZ into SZ3

#errorBoundMode: 6 options to control different types of error bounds
# "ABS", "REL", "PSNR", "NORM", "ABS_AND_REL", "ABS_OR_REL"

#absolute Error Bound (NOTE: it's valid when errorBoundMode is related to ABS (i.e., absolute error bound)
#absErrBound is to limit the (de)compression errors to be within an absolute error.
#For example, absErrBound=0.0001 means the decompressed value must be in [V-0.0001,V+0.0001], where V is the original true value.
#AbsErrorBound = 1

#relative Bound Ratio (NOTE: it's valid only when errorBoundMode is related to REL (i.e., value_range based relative error bound)
#relErrBound is to limit the (de)compression errors by considering the global data value range size (i.e., taking into account the range size (max_value - min_value)).
#For example, suppose relBoundRatio is set to 0.01, and the data set is {100,101,102,103,104,...,110},
#so the global value range size is 110-100=10, so the error bound will actually be 10*0.01=0.1, from the perspective of "relBoundRatio"
#RelErrorBound = 1e-3

#expected PSNR (Note: only valid when ErrorBoundMode = PSNR)
PSNRErrorBound = 70
